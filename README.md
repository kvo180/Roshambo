# Roshambo
A simple rock-paper-scissors app that was built as part of Udacity's UIKit Fundamentals course. 

This app demonstrates the various different approaches to present a new view controller  
(programmatically, with both code and segues, or segues only) and the methods associated with 
each approach. This app also provided a good opportunity to practice essential UIKit concepts 
such as IBOutlets, IBActions, and Storyboard objects as well as essential Swift syntax.
